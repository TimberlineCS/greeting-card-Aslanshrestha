## Discussion

The first thing I did when creating this card was create a background and text. For my background chose to make the background a dark grey to make it look like a Decmember evening. I used the color picker on google to select my color. Another thing I did to start this card was adding in a text. I found this part challengeing because I didn't know to position this text. I ended up using absolute positioning to bring the text to excatly where I wanted it. I found the text was actully an easy fix because when I used absolute positioning I was able to arrange other elements around the text. 

The next thing I did in the making of this card was adding in the tree and the snowman. I found that the tree was much more diffcult than the snowman because the triangles were hard to code than the circles. To code the tree I need the three triangles stacked on top of each other. I found that the coding the trianglea the most diffcult part was guess-checking the width, height, and abosulte postion of each triangle to get them to aglin correcrtly. To get them to show up the way I wanted them I had to figure out that each triangle wouldn't have the top postion, they each be at least 20 pixels below the previous triangle. The hardest part was getting each triangle to be the right distance from the left. Because each triangle had different widths and height they also had different left margin positions. To make the snowman I created a bunch of circle for the eyes and body. This was far essaier than the tree because the only thing I had to change about the circles was the color, size and position. Because I already problems with the triangle positon I knew what to do with the circles. 

The last thing I did in this project was add in the images and the and the song. Adding the images was very easy because I could copy and paste the code I had for one image for the rest of them. I had to change where I wanted the snow images but other than that it was pretty easy to code the images. The song was also easy because I copied and pasted the var audio that was the README.
